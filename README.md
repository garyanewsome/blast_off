Simple vanilla Javascript countdown with some basic CSS animations mixed in for good measure.

If you wish to run this project locally. `git clone` the repo, than you can either launch the `index.html` file directly in your browser or use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser.
